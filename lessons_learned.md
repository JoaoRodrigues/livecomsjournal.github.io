# "Lessons Learned" (Negative Results)

## Waht is a "lesson learned" document
Research inherently involves failure, but without documentation of negative results, investigators are doomed to repeat prior mistakes.
The "Lessons Learned" category will address this gap in the literature in a topic-based way - e.g., "Lessons Learned in Potential of Mean Force Computation."
Authors will be encouraged to add to an existing topic when possible and appropriate (and receive formal authorship credit, as dicsussed elsewhere).
"Lessons learned" articles must conform to standard scientific practices for documentation to ensure a reader could reproduce the reported results, and data analysis should conform to [best practices](https://github.com/dmzuckerman/Sampling-Uncertainty).


## Additional factors considered in review of "lessons learned" documents
Reviewers will consider the following factors in reviewing "lessons learned" document.
* Is the motivation for the approach clearly described and reasonable given existing literature?
* Is the procedure used fully described (and derived mathematically if appropriate) to enable a reader to reproduce the results?
* Are any needed supported files provided?
* Has data analysis been performed in conformance with best practices?

## Revision schedule for "lessons learned" documents
* Once published, unless subsequently there are recognized flaws with or important updates to an already-published negative-result discussion, such article or article section may not require updating.  
* However, for new authors wishing to add to an existing topic-appropriate "Lessons Learned" article, the new authors should work with authors of the existing article, in consultation with editors as needed.
