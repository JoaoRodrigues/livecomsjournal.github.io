These policies are currently a draft, and not yet in force.

## Policies on Decisions 
Issues regarding governance structure, editorial board membership, leadership, and financial model must be decided by a 2/3 majority vote of those members of the editorial board
who vote on the issue.

Other issues, such as editorial policy, licensing policy, can be
decided by a majority vote.

Votes will be are tallied based on the fraction of the editorial board
responding within one week written notice via e-mail. In exceptional
circumstances advance notice may be given of a rush decision, where
the board may be given one week (or more) notice that their votes will
be needed within a shorter window, such as a 12 hour window.
