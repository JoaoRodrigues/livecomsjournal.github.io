excerpt: How early career scientists can get involved with LiveCoMS

We welcome early career scientists (undergraduate students, graduate
students and postdocs) to help participate in LiveCoMS.  There are two
ways you can participate:

* If you are a graduate student or postdoc, we encourage you to sign
  up to be a student reviewer. Please email
  [the managing editors](mailto:managing_editors@livecomsjournal.org)
  with a request to be put on the potential student reviewer
  list. Include a brief description of your expertise, and a short CV
  including publications.

* We encourage you to ask questions and provide comments by filing
  issues on the GitHub repositories for individual LiveCoMS
  papers. The give-and-take and community feedback occurring there is
  extremely valuable for continued development and clarity of the
  papers. Additionally, LiveCoMS articles are explicitly asked
  acknowledge students who make contributions via the GitHub
  page. Significant and ongoing participation that improves the
  document may even lead to eventual inclusion as an author on future
  versions (at the discretion of the current authors)
