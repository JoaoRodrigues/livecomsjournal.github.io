  We very much appreciate financial donations to LiveCoMS! Donations are made
  to the University of Colorado Boulder, the official publisher of the journal, to a fund exclusively for the
  use of LiveCoMS and controlled by the managing editors. Follow the link below to donate:

You can also support LiveCoMS by:
  * Contributing to LiveCoMS articles.
  * Expressing your interest in becoming a reviewer ([early career](/about/earlycareer) or otherwise).
  * Providing feedback on GitHub repositories for published articles to improve later versions of LiveCoMS articles.
  * Citing LiveCoMS articles that you use in your research.
  * Spreading the word about LiveCoMS to your colleagues, mentors, and students.


###Financial costs for LiveCoMS

LiveCoMS runs a very lean budget in order to keep costs for
contributors low.  Managing editors and editorial board members
receive no money or reimbursement from LiveCoMS.  Our current costs
are:

* $1200/year for journal hosting by [Scholastica](http://www.scholasticahq.com).
* $250/year for reviewer services by [Scholastica](http://www.scholasticahq.com).
* $504/year for Google Suites hosting of email and collaborative office software

The main sources of income for LiveCoMS are donations and article
charges. We in particular appreciate seed funding provided by [CU
Boulder Libraries](https://www.colorado.edu/libraries/), as well as continuing in-kind contributions by
managing DOI submissions and journal metadata. Article charges are
$100 for each article upon submission, from which we receive about
$80 after charges from Scholastica and processing fees.

If we raise more money through donations than cover our costs, we will work to:
  * Hire web developers and designers to support better .tex templates and improvements to the website
  * Investigate advertising options to better raise awareness of the journal and its purposes. 
  * Hire copy editors to assist in final journal submissions
  * Waiving submission fees in part (based on need) or in whole.
  * Create a buffer for future financial issues.
