1. Organization Title and Publication

   The Journal shall be called the Living Journal of Computational
   Molecular Science, hereafter referred to as LiveCoMS.

   LiveCoMS shall produce one publication, the Living Journal of
   Computational Molecular Science, with articles released on a rolling
   basis online. LiveCoMS provides a home for peer-reviewed home manuscripts
   which advance best practices in molecular modeling and simulation. These
   works are living documents, regularly updated with community input,
   and can include living or perpetual reviews, tutorials, comparisons
   between software packages, and other documents which aim to improve
   the studies in the field and require ongoing updates.  

1. Editorial Board

   The Editorial Board shall consist of three Managing Editors, a Section Lead 
   Editor for each type of document published in LiveCoMS, any number of 
   Associate Editors, and a Recording Secretary. Section Lead Editors may be 
   either Managing Editors or Associate Editors.

   1. Responsibilities
       1. The Managing Editors coordinate the operation of the Journal and
          the finances of the journal, maintain the online presence.  Tasks
          may be divided up among managing editors as they see fit, and specific
          individual tasks may be assigned to individual associate editors.
       1. Section Lead Editors handle submitted manuscripts and assign
          all manuscripts to associate lead editors. Section lead editors make decisions on
          presubmission letters proposing manuscripts, in which they
          may be advised by the associate editors. Section lead editors make final decisions
          based on recommendations from the associate editors, and communicate
          them to the authors.
       1. Associate Editors assign manuscripts to reviewers, collect
          these reviews, and make recommendations to the Section Lead
          Editors about acceptance, rejection, or requests for revision.
       1. The Recording Secretary will coordinate and maintain confidentiality of
          votes of the Editorial Board and record minutes of meetings of the Editorial Board.

   1. Selection process
       1. Members of the Editorial Board will be elected by a two-thirds vote of the Editorial Board.
         1. Managing editors and section lead editors will be elected by a two-thirds vote of the
            entire Editorial Board by the other current members of the Editorial Board when there is a
            vacancy in either capacity.
         1. Associate editors will be elected based on:
            1. Demonstrated scholarly expertise in computational molecular science, broadly defined.
            1. Stated commitment to contribute to decision making and maintenance of LiveCoMS.
            1. Candidates will be favored who have shown excellence in reviewing for LiveCoMS, 
	    based on independent evaluations
	    of the members of the Editorial Board, and who have a history of contributing manuscripts to LiveCoMS.
            1. Diversity in career background, geographical perspectives, life experiences, and any other factors that are seen as beneficial to represent the broader community, provide fairness in decisions, and include a range of viewpoints.
	    1. All members on the Editorial Board shall be elected in a fair, impartial, and confidential process without regard to race, nationality, religion, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, or familial status.
         1. Managing editors will be elected based on:
            1. all criteria outlined for associate editors, plus demonstrated excellence serving as an associate editor.
	 1. The Recording Secretary will be nominated by the Managing editors from among the associate editors.
   1. Appointments Terms
      1. Appointment for all positions are for three years, which may be extended for an unlimited 
	 number of terms by a vote of two/thirds of the remaining Editorial Board. If the terms of more 
         than one third of the Editorial Board end at the same time, all may remain in their positions for 
         long enough for additional editors be appointed, or one month, which ever comes first. 
      2. At the time the bylaws are adopted, the three managing editorial terms will be for two, three, and four years,
         determined by mutual agreement or random chance if no agreement is reached.
   1. Voting
      1. All votes described in the bylaws are tallied based on the fraction
         of the Editorial Board responding within one week written notice
         via e-mail or other voting mechanism approved by the managing
         editors. In exceptional circumstances advance notice may be given
         of a rush decision, where the board may be given one week (or more)
         notice that their votes will be needed within a shorter window,
         such as a 12 hour window.

1. Conflicts of interest
   1. A 'conflict of interest' is defined as any of:
      1. being a close co-author on a paper together for up to 48 months after publication. "Close co-author" is defined as serving as corresponding author and/or first author together, or equivalent close collaboration.  This definition was chosen to avoid overly restrictive limitations for papers with large numbers of loosely-associated contributing authors, and will have some leeway for interpretation as outlined below.
      1. a co-awardee on a grant for up to 48 months after the grant, or that currently have a cooperative pending grant.
      1. if there exists a postdoctoral or graduate advisor relationship at any time in the past.
      1. at the same institution, or if there is a potential change of institution in progress that would result in being at the same institution.
      1. having a business relationship (such as serving as a consultant for or part owner of same company) within 48 months.

   1. Editors will try to avoid conflicts of interest with the authors when assigning manuscripts to reviewers.  If the reviewer notices a conflict of interest, they will report it to the editor so the manuscript may be reassigned. If they have any co-authorships with any author within the last 48 months that they consider not close co-authorship, they will report these to the assigning editor for the associate editor for approval as not being "close co-authorships".

   1. If it is later discovered that a reviewer has a conflict of interest with an author during the review process, this review will be discarded, and another review will be sought.

   1. If a conflict of interest in a reviewer is found after acceptance, the associate editor will evaluate whether any bias may have unduly affected the acceptance. If the associate editor feels they themselves may be unfairly biased, a committee of three associate editors selected by the Section Lead Editor will investigate whether any favoritism, discrimination, or fraud was intended in the review, and will follow procedures to determine whether acceptance was fraudulent as outlined by the bylaws on fraud.

   1. Parallel policies hold in the case of the section lead editor assigning an associate editor a paper. 
      1. Section lead editors will try to not assign given conflicts of interest, and associate editors will notify section lead editors if they are assigned a manuscript with which they have a conflict of interest.  
      1. Co-authorships that are not considered close will be reported to the section lead editors.  
      1. If conflicts of interest with the associate editor are later discovered, the manuscript will be assigned by he section lead editor to another associate editor, who will evaluate whether new reviewers should be invited.  
      1. If a conflict of interest is found after acceptance, the section lead editor will evaluate whether bias may have unduly affected the acceptance. If so, a similar committee of three associate editors will investigate if the acceptance was fraudulent. 

   1. If a Section Lead Editor has a conflict of interest with a manuscript, the
assignment to Associate Editors will be made by another Section Lead
Editor.  The order of reassignment will be cyclic; if Lead Section Editor 1 has a
conflict, it will got to Lead Section Editor 2, unless they also have
a conflict, in which case it will go to 3, and so on, returning to 1
when the sections are exhausted. In the case that all of the section lead
editors have conflicts, the Managing Editors will select an associate editor to assign an associate editor.
      1. Comparison of Molecular Simulation Package Editor
      1. Tutorials Editor
      1. Best Practices Editor
      1. Review Editor
      1. Lessons Learned Editor
      1. continuing with editors of other sections, in order they are chronologically added to the journal.

1. Fraud and Plagiarism

    1. Definitions:

       1. 'Plagiarism' is defined as including any clearly recognizable
amount of text from a previous publication without attribution.

       1. 'Fraud' is defined as any false representation of the circumstances of the paper or the data contained in the paper. It could include fraudulent data, or fraudulently obtained reviews (through collusion with a reviewer or editor).

    1. If there is a suspicion or accusation of fraud or plagiarism, a
       committee of three members of the Editorial Board will be
       chosen by the managing editors to investigate.  

    1. If this committee decides unanimously that fraud or plagiarism
       occurred, then the paper will be removed from the journal, and
       the author will not be allowed to submit to LiveCoMS for at
       least three years, and must petition to the board to be allowed
       to resubmit, which must be approved by a two-thirds vote. The
       managing editors may notify the authors' institution of the finding 
       of fraud or plagiarism, along with evidence used to reach that finding.

1. Review Process

    1. Review criteria that editors use shall be posted on the author
       instructions section of the website. These review criteria will be
       revised for clarity periodically in response to feedback, with the
       approval of the Section Lead Editor.

    2. Section Lead Editors make the final decision about reviews in
       consultation with the associate editor assigned to the
       paper. In some cases, authors may appeal an editorial decision, 
       but initiating an appeal requires the consent of all authors. 
       In case of an appeal on the decision, the Section Lead
       Editor will select another associate editor to review all
       materials associated with the decision. If the second editor is in agreement
       with the first editor, the decision will stand and cannot be
       additionally appealed.  If the second editor disagrees with the
       first decision, a third editor will be selected by the Section
       Lead Editor, and a majority vote will be taken, which will be
       final.

1. Amendments

   These bylaws may be amended by two-thirds of the vote of the entire
   Editorial Board.
