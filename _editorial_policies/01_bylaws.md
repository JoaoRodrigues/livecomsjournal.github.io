I) Organization Title and Publication

The Journal shall be called the Living Journal of Computational
Molecular Science, hereafter referred to as LiveCoMS.

Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science shall produce one
publication the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science,
with articles released on a rolling basis. LiveCoMS provides a
peer-reviewed home for manuscripts which share best practices in
molecular modeling and simulation. These works are living documents,
regularly updated with community input, and can include living or
perpetual reviews, tutorials, comparisons between software packages,
and other documents which aim to improve the studies in the field and
require ongoing updates.

II) Editorial Board

The editorial board shall consist of three Managing Editors, any
number of Associate Editors, and a Section Lead Editor for each type
of document published in LiveCoMS. Section Lead Editors may be either
Managing Editors or Associate Editors.

  i) Responsibilities
     1) The Managing Editors coordinate the operation of the Journal and
  the finances of the journal, maintain the online presence.  Tasks
  may be divided up among managing editors as they see fit.
 
     2) Section Lead Editors handles submitted manuscripts and assigns
  all manuscripts to associate lead editors.

makes final
  decisions and communicate them to the authors. 

     3) Associate Editors assign manuscripts to revieers 


    ii) Eligibility Criteria

       * Demonstrated scholarly expertise in computational molecualar science, broadly defined.
       * Stated commitment to contributed to decision making and maintenance of LiveCoMS
       * Candidates will be favored who have shown excellence in the review process, based on independent evaluations
of the members of the editorial board, and who have a history of contributions to LiveCoMS

    iii) Appointments

       * 

 VI) Amendment

These bylaws may be amended by two thirds of the vote of the entire
Editorial Board.  Votes will be are tallied based on the fraction of
the editorial board responding within one week written notice via
e-mail. In exceptional circumstances advance notice may be given of a
rush decision, where the board may be given one week (or more) notice
that their votes will be needed within a shorter window, such as a 12
hour window.

V) Conflicts of interest.

No Editor shall assign an Associate Editor if they have a conflict of
interest with a paper. No Associate Editor may manage a paper if they
have a conflict of interest, and shall notify the Section Lead Editor
if they do have a conflict.



If a Section Lead Editor has a conflict of interest, the assignments
to Associate Editors will be made by another Section Lead Eeditor.
The order will be cyclic; if Lead Section Editor A has a conflict, it
will got to Lead Section Editor B, unless they also have a conflict,
in which case it will go to C, and so on, returning to A when the
sections are exhausted. In the case that all of the lead editors have
conflicts, they will jointly pick an Associate Editor who will then
assign another Associate Editor to manage the manuscript.

A. Comparison of Molecular Simulation Package Editor
B. Tutorials Editor
C. Best Practices Editor 
D. Review Editor 
E. Lessons Learned Editor
F. and onward. editor of other sections, in order they are chronologically added.
